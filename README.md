# Refraction-through-atmosphere
This project was done as a part of Computational Physics PH 887 course at National Institute of Technology Karnataka.
The code uses numerical methods for calculating the angle of refraction of light through the layers of atmosphere.
It is one of the first attempts at modelling the bending of light through atmosphere without using Snell's law.
